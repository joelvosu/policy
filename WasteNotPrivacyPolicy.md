- To analyze error logs to improve the App's performance and user experience.
- To communicate with you about updates, account-related matters, or customer support.

3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except as described below:

7. Your Choices and Rights
- Account Data: You can update or delete your account information by accessing the App's settings or contacting us.

- Opt-Out: You can uninstall the App at any time to stop data collection.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The updated policy will be posted in the App, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
