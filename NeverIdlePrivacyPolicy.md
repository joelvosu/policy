# Privacy Policy for Never Idle

Last updated: April 29, 2025

## Introduction
Never Idle ("we," "us," or "our") is a task management application designed to help you organize tasks with categories, comments, and secure backup/restore features. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use Never Idle ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not collect or share personal data over the network.

## Data We Collect
The App does not collect or transmit any personal data to our servers or third parties. All data is stored locally on your device. Specifically:

- **Task Data**: The App stores your tasks, including task names, categories, completion status, and optional comments, locally on your device using `AsyncStorage`. This data is not sent to any external servers.
- **Backup and Restore**: When you use the backup feature, the App creates a JSON file containing your task data and theme settings, which is saved to a location you choose (e.g., your device’s file system or cloud storage via sharing). The restore feature allows you to import such JSON files. These operations are user-initiated and do not involve our servers.
- **No Network Data**: The App does not use internet connectivity or collect data such as device IDs, IP addresses, or location information.

## How We Use Your Data
- **Local Storage**: Task data is stored locally to provide the core functionality of the App, such as displaying and managing your tasks.
- **Backup and Restore**: Backup files are created and accessed solely at your request to ensure you can save or restore your data.
- **No Sharing**: We do not share your data with third parties, as all operations are performed locally on your device.

## Data Security
We prioritize the security of your data:
- Task data is stored securely in `AsyncStorage` on your device.
- Backup files are saved to locations you control, and we recommend using secure storage options (e.g., password-protected cloud services).
- The App does not transmit data over the internet, reducing the risk of interception.

## Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate with third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks that collect user data.

## Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us to have it removed.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App’s functionality or legal requirements. Updates will be posted at this URL, and the “Last updated” date will be revised. Please check periodically for changes.
